# Boulder divergences from ACME

While Boulder attempts to implement the ACME specification as strictly as possible
there are places at which we will diverge from the letter of the specification for
various reason.

This document details these differences and the reasoning behind them. Since ACME
is not yet finalized it will be updated to be up to date with the most recent
numbered draft that has been published.

Current draft: [`draft-ietf-acme-acme-03`](https://github.com/ietf-wg-acme/acme/blob/aef618ad843270d8363c5cb14038d1683f9b1cf8/draft-ietf-acme-acme.md)
